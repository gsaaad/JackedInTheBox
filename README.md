## Project Description
A project that will aid the user in achieving an active lifestyle. The project tracks the users height, weight and strength training.  

This project helps the user continue their training by holding them accountable when goals are not met as well as helping the user search for and find new workouts.  

Our goal was to create an activity tracker that was not overly complicated and user friendly to ensure that people of all fitness levels can enjoy this app and continue making their personal progress.
